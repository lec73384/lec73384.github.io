<h3><font size="5" color="lightcoral">Panda facts</font></h3>
	<P> 	Pandas are one of the world's largest cuddly looking mammals that are on the verge of extinction. What makes 
	these animals unique is their coloration and eyes. They have cat-like eyes and are typically white and black.
	The males and females differetiate in weight and like humans, the typical male weights more. Pandas have a strict diet
	that really only includes bamboo which lacks great nutrition.Since they spend most of their time eating this tough crop of bamboo, their teeth are very important
	to their survival. Of thier 42 teeth, many are molars and a few are sharp incisors. Pandas also have a thick coat of oily fur, which
	keeps them warm in the cold wet mountainous areas of China.</P>

<h3><font size="5" color="lightcoral">Save the pandas</font></h3>
<P> 	Pandas are going extinct due to destruction to their habiat by hunters. Currently, there are only a little over 2000 pandas left in the world.
 In China, there are many organizations that are fully motivated to the cause of panda endangerment. These orgainzations are currently these fluffy creatures
 only chance at surviving the odds. Recent efforts have actually caused the counts of pandas to increase, which is great news! Unfortunatley their only source of 
 food, bamboo, is expected to decline heavily. These organizations that are set up are truly needed to save the pandas! Some of these organizations</P>

 <h3><font size="5" color="lightcoral">My personal panda experience </font></h3>
 <P> Pandas, although orginate in China, can be found all over the United States in many zoos. Zoos although are a very controversial topic, give
many children a way to see these animals they may not get to see. When I was little, I went to the zoo with my cousin, my aunt, and my mom.
I was around the age of ten and my cousin was about five. Leading up to our trip to the zoo all she could talk about was how excited she was to see
the pandas. We were there for hours at the ST. Louis zoo. We had so much fun looking at all the different types of animals this place had to offer- most being
ones we had never seen before. When we got to the panda exhibit, my cousin was estatic. This black and white furry creature, that she had never seen face-to-face, was
seemingly a mystery until this point. We watched their slow movements and intereactions with the other two pandas. Their movments are so sluggish and slow due to their weight
and also probably the small enclosure. We watched how they ate bamboo and how they played with eachother, which was loving and playful.
The sad part about these fluffy creatures is that they are going extinct and at some point not everyone will get the opportunity to see a panda first hand.
They will only be able to watch old videos of them or get a panda stuffed animal, as my cousin did on the way out of the zoo.</P>
